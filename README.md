# CIT 230  & CIT336
A repo for the challenge exam.

## The Story

I read through the course description at byui and thought to myself,
"Hey! I can do that!" After a few emails I was assigned a Challenge Exam
to prove that I knew the content of the couse. It was to build and a
Content Management System in PHP. I passed both classes and was
asked to post my solution on github.
